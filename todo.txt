mvp:
    time zone
    change app name from "fear the sweep" on twilio authy as it sounds super creepy when doing call notification
    validate inputs and give error message if they are wrong
    remove favicon
    generic message eg "you have street sweeping in one hour!", "you have street sweeping tomorrow at 2:30!"

extra:
    add months to be reminded
    remind at arbitrary amount of hours before (up to 48 hours)
