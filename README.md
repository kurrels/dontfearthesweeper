Street Sweeping Reminders

To run the application, you must have go installed. see here: <https://golang.org/doc/install>

I also recomend you use gin to run the application. Gin makes it so that you don't have to restart your server every time you make a change to your code. Once you have Go set up on your computer, you can install gin by running `go get github.com/codegangsta/gin`

When you have gin, you can run the application by going into the project folder and runing `gin`.

You will need some environment variables set. Specifically, you will have to set an env variable called 'STREETSWEEP_AUTHY_API_KEY'. Get the api key directly from me (on slack or email).

Once you have the application running, go to localhost:3000 in your browser (or instead of 3000, use whichever port gin tells you to use when you first run gin).

Let me know if you have trouble setting this up, and I'll help you out -mike
