Street Sweeping Reminders

To run the application, you must have go installed. see here: <https://golang.org/doc/install>

I also recomend you use gin to run the application. Gin makes it so that you don't have to restart your server every time you make a change to your code. Once you have Go set up on your computer, you can install gin by running `go get github.com/codegangsta/gin`

When you have gin, you can run the application by going into the project folder and runing `gin`.

You will need some environment variables set. Specifically, you will have to set an env variable called 'STREETSWEEP_AUTHY_API_KEY'. Get the api key directly from me (on slack or email).

Let me know if you have trouble setting this up, and I'll help you out -mike
